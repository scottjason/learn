### Imperative and Procedural

*Note: Procedural programming is a type of imperative programming in which the program is built from one or more procedures.

**Imperative approach (HOW):**  
**Declarative approach (WHAT)**

An imperative approach (HOW): I see that table located under the Gone Fishin’ sign is empty. My husband and I are going to walk over there and sit down.

A declarative approach (WHAT): Table for two, please.

The imperative approach is concerned with HOW you’re actually going to get a seat. You need to list out the steps to be able to show HOW you’re going to get a table.The declarative approach is more concerned with WHAT you want, a table for two.



**Imperative details are often abstracted away in declarative programming.**
