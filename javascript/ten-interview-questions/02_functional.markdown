## 2. What is functional programming?

**Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions and avoids shared state & mutable data.**

It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

**Pure Functions:**  
**Avoids side-effects**   
**Function Composition**

A pure function is deterministic. This means, that given the same input, the function will always return the same output. A pure function will not cause side effects. A side effect is any change in the system that is observable to the outside world.

**Features that support FP:** 
- First-class functions   
- Higher Order functions  
- Functions as arguments/values
